## üìå Project Status: Incomplete

This project is currently in an active development phase and is **not considered complete**. There are essential components that still require implementation:

Server-side Integration: The server-side functionality, including setting up the server architecture, defining APIs, and handling data communication between the client-side and server-side components, is currently in progress.

Sorting Algorithms Integration: Sorting algorithms have been developed but have not yet been integrated into the system. These algorithms will play a crucial role in sorting and organizing data within our JSON files to enhance efficiency and usability

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview

- **Add Data:** Users can add new entries to the database by providing the necessary information
- **Change Data:** Users have the ability to update existing data within the JSON files
- **Delete Data:** The application also allows users to remove records as needed
